# Bi-Infer
Existing deepfake detection methods typically perform well on uncompressed videos but suffer significant performance degradation under various compression rates. To address this challenge, we have introduced a novel lightweight detector called Bi-Infer, which is a dual stream model that processes two types of facial landmark sequences to identify fake videos. Bi-Infer utilizes facial landmarks and their relationships to improve detection accuracy. The model first performs bidirectional inference on facial landmarks, and then uses the spatial-temporal correlation to verify the authenticity of the target video. Even in compressed videos, these correlations remain robust. Experimental results demonstrate that Bi-Infer outperforms existing approaches across various compression rates. When trained on the raw FF++ dataset and tested on FF++(c23), our model achieves an accuracy of 99.21\%, which is 6.71\% higher than the state-of-the-art. When tested on FF++(c40), it records an 8.53\% increase in accuracy, reaching 88.21\%. When tested on the DF-1.0 dataset, our method achieved the highest AUC score of 89.73\%.

Our code will be fully released soon.
